 We take this opportunity to introduce ourselves as one of the leading Mechanical and Structural fabricator and erector in Nepal, having a fully-equipped facility extending over 12500 m2 in Chainpur-1, Chitwan with a total built up area of 1500 m2. Safe Steels has gained this shape after being merged with the pioneer industry of the sector: Nepa Engineering Works, a four decade experienced company, situated in Nepalgunj. The factory is equipped with modern and advanced technological facility for the fabrication and galvanization of steel structures with capacity of 5000 metric tons per year. The merit of our company is to offer a comprehensive service (Design, Fabrication, Galvanization, Supply and Erection) in the field of Mechanical and Steel Structure Engineering Services.
